# Suggestions
1.
Cancellation rates rise as the price does. In order to prevent cancellations of reservations, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rate for specific hotels based on locations. They can also provide some discounts to the consumers.
2.
As the ratio of the cancellation and not cancellation of the resort hotel is higher in the resort hotel than the city hotels. So the hotels should provide a reasonable discount on the room prices on weekends or on holidays.
3.
In the month of January , hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a reasonable amount to increase their revenue as the cancellation is highest in this month.
4.
They can also increases the quality of their hotels and services mainly in Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate.
